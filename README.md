## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the application.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.

## Description

The application is an API that offers CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations to interact with data stored in a database. This data can be of any type and will be accessible through the API.

The API is practical because it allows developers to interact with the data without worrying about the details of the underlying implementation. Additionally, the automatically generated documentation makes it easy to understand how to use the API.

Technically, the API uses the FastAPI framework, which provides a fast and efficient implementation of the OpenAPI specification. The application also uses a SQLAlchemy-compatible database to store the data.

The API is useful for different use cases, such as storing and retrieving information in a database, implementing web services, and integrating systems. With this API, developers can create applications that interact with the data stored in the database quickly and easily.
